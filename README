To compile the development, simply run [coq_makefile -f Make -o Makefile; make]
in the toplevel directory, with coqc in your path. You need to use 
the polyproj branch of Coq available at github.com/mattam82/coq.git 
(commit 0442ed0b8e7239c61661acbe31c05f26a8e109e4, compile with -no-native-compiler) 
to compile this code, as it makes use of universe polymorphism and fast projections.
