To compile the development, simply run [coq_makefile -f Make -o Makefile; make]
in the toplevel directory, with coqc in your path. You need Coq's development
version (github.com/coq/coq.git branch master, 
commit c4ecec191130a51975bf97d067472e0e5bd744f5, compile with -no-native-compiler) 
to compile this code, as it makes use of universe polymorphism and fast projections.
