\subsection{The proof assistant}
\label{sec:proof-assistant}
We use the latest version (8.5) of the \Coq proof assistant to formally define
our translation\footnote{At the time of writing, a beta version is
  available}. Vanilla features of \Coq allow us to define overloaded
notations and hierarchies of structures through type classes
\cite{sozeau.Coq/classes/fctc}, and to separate definitions and proofs
using the \Program extension \cite{sozeau.Coq/FingerTrees/article}, they
are both documented in \Coq's reference manual \cite{coq:refman:8.5}.
We also use the recent extension to polymorphic
universes~\cite{DBLP-conf/itp/SozeauT14}.


\subsubsection{Classes and projections.}
The formalization makes heavy use of type classes and sigma types, both
defined internally as parameterized records. We also use the new
representation of record projections, making them primitive to allow a
more economical representation, leaving out the parameters of the record
type they are applied to. This change, which is justified by
bidirectional presentations of type theory, makes typechecking
exponentially faster in the case of nested structures (see
\cite{garillot:pastel-00649586} for a detailed explanation of this phenomenon).



% not including In the usual Calculus of
% Inductive Constructions, records are encoded as non-recursive inductive
% types with a single constructor and their projections are defined by
% pattern-matching. While this representation is adequate, it is
% inefficient in terms of space and time consumption as projection
% $\coqdocvar{p}$ from a parameterized record
% $\coqdocind{R}~(\coqdocvar{A} : \Type{}) := \{ \coqdoccst{p} :
% \coqdocvar{A} \}$ have type $Π A : \Type{},
% \coqdocind{R}~\coqdocvar{A} → \coqdocvar{A}$. Every application of a
% projection hence repeats the parameters of the record, which in the
% nested case results in a exponential blowup in the size of terms,
% and typechecking likewise repeats work unnecessarily . We
% modified the representation of record projections to skip parameters,
% which is also justified by bidirectional presentations of type theory,
% to recover a workable formalization.

One peculiarity of \Coq's class system we use is the ability to nest
classes. We use the \coqdoccst{A\_of\_B} \coqcode{:>} \coqdocind{A} notation in a type class
definition \coqdockw{Class} \coqdocind{B} as an abbreviation for
defining \coqdoccst{A\_of\_B} as an instance of \coqdocind{A}.

\subsubsection{Polymorphic Universes.}
\label{sec:polym-univ}
\def\Types{\coqdockw{Type}s\xspace}

  % Type theories such as the Calculus of Inductive Constructions maintain
  % a universe hierarchy to prevent paradoxes that naturally appear if one
  % is not careful about the sizes of types that are manipulated in the
  % language. To ensure consistency while not troubling the user with 
  % this necessary information, systems using typical ambiguity were
  % designed. We present an elaboration from terms using typical ambiguity 
  % into explicit terms which also accomodates universe polymorphism, i.e.
  % the ability to write a term once and use it at different universe
  % levels. Elaboration relies on an enhanced type inference algorithm to 
  % provide the freedom of typical ambiguity while also supporting
  % polymorphism, in a fashion similar to usual Hindley-Milner polymorphic
  % type inference. This elaboration is implemented as a drop-in
  % replacement for the existing universe system of Coq and has been
  % benchmarked favorably against the previous version. We demonstrate how
  % it provides a solution to a number of formalization issues present in
  % the original system.

To typecheck our formalization, we also need an expressive universe
system. Indeed, if we are to give a uniform (shallow) translation of
type theory in type theory, we have to define a translation of the
\type{} universe (a groupoid) as a term of the calculus and equip type
constructors like $Π$ and $Σ$ with \interp{\type{}} structures as
well. As \interp{\type{}} itself contains a \Type{}, the following
situation occurs when we define the translation of, e.g. sums: we should
have \interp{Σ~U~T\ \type{}} = \interp{Σ} \interp{U} \interp{T} :
\interp{\type}. To ensure consistency of the interpretations of types
inside \interp{U}, \interp{T} and the outer one, they must be at
different levels, with the outer one at least as large as the inner
ones. The universe polymorphic extension of \Coq has been designed to
allow such highly generic developments~\cite{DBLP-conf/itp/SozeauT14}.
The design was implemented by the first author and is already used to
check the \name{HoTT} library in \Coq \cite{HoTT/HoTT}.

% This is however not supported in the current
% version of \Coq, as the universe system does not allow a definition to
% live at different levels. Hence, there could be only one universe level
% assigned to the translation of any \Type{} and they couldn't be nested,
% as this would result in an obvious inconsistency: the usual \Type{} :
% \Type{} inconsistency would show up as \interp{\Type{}} :
% \interp{\Type{}}. One solution to this problem would be to have $n$
% different interpretations of \Type{} to handle $n$ different levels of
% universes.  This is clearly unsatisfactory, as this would mean
% duplicating every lemma and every structure depending on the translation
% of types, and the numer of duplications would depend on the use of
% universes at the source level. Instead, we can extend the system with
% universe polymorphic definitions that are parametric on universe levels
% and instantiate them at different ones, just like parametric
% polymorphism is used to instantiate a definition at different
% types. This can be interpreted as building fresh instances of the
% constant that can be handled by the core type checker without
% polymorphism.  We give a detailed presentation of this system in 
% Section \ref{sec:type-theory-with}, but as the handling of universes stays
% entirely implicit at the source level, we just present here the core
% calculus on which the universe polymorphism system and our
% interpretation rests.
